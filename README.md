# Urban Insight: Advanced SQL Data Analysis

## Introduction
This project demonstrates advanced SQL techniques and optimizations on the Minneapolis Crime Data.

## Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Generate insightful reports and visualizations
- Demonstrate advanced SQL techniques (CTEs, window functions, indexing)
- Optimize SQL queries for performance

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset.
- `scripts/`: SQL scripts for data analysis and optimization.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebook for EDA.
- `reports/`: Project report.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.
